# ShantaeText
Text Injecting and Extracting Software for Shantae on GBC.

Works with the USA version of the game.

The Extractor outputs a file named textBank.txt in the same folder of the .exe, which can be easily edited.

The Injector inserts in the ROM the edited textBank.txt file.

The injection is optimized.

It doesn't extract all the text, but most of it.

Missing text can be found around these locations: 0x10100, 0x285AB, 0x48AD0, 0x49370, 0x7C800.

If prompted the error "Error. Bank -x is too big" while injecting, it means your text is too big! Due to how the GB/GBC handles this with banks, we can't put the text in another place. "-x" tells you the bank of text that's too big. Entries from 0 to 3FFF are bank 1, entries from 4000 to 7FFF are bank 2 and entries from 8000 to BFFF are bank 3. Trimmer your text accordingly!
