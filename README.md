# ShantaeText
Text Injecting and Extracting Software for Shantae on GBC.

The Extractor outputs a file named textBank.txt, which can be easily edited.

The Injector inserts in the ROM the edited textBank.txt file.

The injection is optimized.

It doesn't extract all the text, but most of it.

Missing text can be found around these locations: 0x10100, 0x48AD0, 0x49370, 0x7C800.
